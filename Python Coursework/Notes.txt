Consists of a number of rallies
each rally, the player who starts is the server, other is the returner
a player wins a rally if the other player is unable to make a legal shot

Matches usually play over a number of games

winner being the player who reaches a certain score first
pro matches played over 5 games, first to win 3 matches

Point A Rally Scoring PARS
Winner of each rally receives a point (regardless of who serves)
first player to reach at least 11 or more points and have 2 more than their opponent wins the game
if the server wins a rally, they stay as server
if the returner wins a rally, they become the server

English Scoring
Only the server is awarded a point if they win a rally
if the server wins a rally, they receive a point and stay serving
if the returner wins a rally, they serve but don't get a point
the first player to reach 9 points win unless the score is 8-8
if the score is 8-8, the player who first reached 8, decides to play to 9 or 10

Player Ability
Integer value
0 < rX <= 100

Probability of A winning
P(A) = rA/(rA + rB)

Y against X

1e)

probabilityWin(ra,ra,n) gives us the probability that a wins any given game against b, call this P(a)
We want to figure out the probability of a winning n games, call this P(an)
P(an) = P(a)^n

Playing a match where the player to win n games first wins the match
